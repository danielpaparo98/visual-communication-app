    <h2>Made with <span class="talking-chart">&#10084;</span></h2>
    <p>
      I created this web app and made it freely available to hopefully help others who may be in the same 
      situation as my family was a couple of years ago. When my uncle became unable to verbally communicate due 
      to his declining health, we decided to create a set of communication charts so he could quickly and concisely 
      talk to his family and medical staff. When I searched online for a visual communication chart creator, I learnt 
      that there were no free or easy apps for creating them. Instead, I spent the best part of an afternoon sourcing 
      icons and designing a chart that would be easily readable for all parties. The charts were used by medical staff 
      who commented on how useful they were for communicating with my uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
    I believe that the vast majority of people in this same situation would not have the time nor effort available to manually 
      create these useful visual communication charts. I made this app in the hopes that others would be able to create 
      communication charts quickly and easily – and allow those having difficulties communicating verbally, to communicate visually.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am still actively developing this application in my free time. If there are any issues you run into or you have a 
      suggestion for improving the app, please feel free to get in contact and I’ll see how I can help!
